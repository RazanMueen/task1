Theoretical Part:
1.

a) git status
   displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It lets you see which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git.

b) git init
   starts a new Git project. It sets up Git in the folder so we can track changes. It’s usually the first command we use in a new project.

c) git commit
    saves the changes 

d) git push
   sends the saved changes to GitHub so others can see them too.

I don’t agree, (git add) lets us choose which changes you want to save.
Without it, we can’t control our work well.
It helps us stay organized and avoid mistakes.
