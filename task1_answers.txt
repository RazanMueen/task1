Theoretical Part:
1.

a) git status
   displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It lets you see which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git.

b) git init
   starts a new Git project. It sets up Git in the folder so we can track changes. It’s usually the first command we use in a new project.

c) git commit
    saves the changes 

d) git push
   sends the saved changes to GitHub so others can see them too.

I don’t agree, (git add) lets us choose which changes you want to save.
Without it, we can’t control our work well.
It helps us stay organized and avoid mistakes.

3. Answer the following questions about code hosting providers.

a. List two popular code hosting platforms besides GitHub.
GitLab

Bitbucket

b. What key features do code hosting providers offer to enhance version control for both individual developers and collaborative development environments?
Branching and Merging: Allows developers to work on separate features or bugs and then merge their changes back into the main project.

Pull Requests: Enables collaborative code review and feedback before merging changes into the main branch.

Issue Tracking: Helps manage and track bugs, tasks, and feature requests.

Continuous Integration (CI): Automatically builds and tests code every time changes are pushed to the repository.

Access Control: Permissions and access settings help manage who can view or edit code in the repository.

History and Auditing: Keeps a detailed log of all changes, making it easy to revert to previous versions or check what changes were made by whom.

c. True or False: A team can collaborate on a software project without relying on popular code hosting providers by setting up their own self-hosted server for version control.
True.

A team can set up a self-hosted Git server (using tools like GitLab CE, Gitea, or even a bare Git repository on their own server) to manage version control and collaborate without relying on GitHub or other hosting providers.

4. What does the -u flag in the git push -u origin main command signify, and how does it impact the behavior of the git push and git pull commands in subsequent usage?
The -u flag in git push -u origin main is used to set the upstream branch. This means:

It links your local main branch to the main branch on the remote repository (origin).

After using -u once, you can use simpler commands like git push and git pull without needing to specify origin main each time, because Git will remember where to push or pull from.

In simpler terms, the -u flag establishes a default relationship between your local branch and the remote branch.
